## Tex styles for Science

It can be quite a chore to rummage through websites and find the correct
style templates for the different journals (many in Ecology and Evolution).
This is why I am compiling them
here, with a shell script that will automatically pull the updates versions
when needed. This is mostly for personal use, though  somebody may find it useful.

The repro also contains a growing list of generic templates, and will
grow with time.

## Installation

Just download the [zip](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/TsSc/zipball/master) 
or [tar ball](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/TsSc/tarball/master).
Then decompress and use the style files in your .tex documents.
